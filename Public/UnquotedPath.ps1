    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Get-UnquotedServicePaths finds Windows services with paths that should be wrapped in double quotes but aren't.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The Get-UnquotedServicePaths cmdlet checks Windows services' paths to identify any services whose paths contain spaces but are not enclosed in double quotes. In Windows, service paths with spaces should be enclosed in double quotes to prevent issues with path parsing.

    By running this cmdlet, you can identify services with paths that may not follow the correct quoting convention and take appropriate action, such as correcting the service configuration.

    .PARAMETER None
    This cmdlet does not accept any parameters.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-UnquotedServicePaths

    .INPUTS
    None. The cmdlet does not accept any input.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.String[]
    The cmdlet outputs an array of strings representing the service paths that should be wrapped in double quotes but aren't.
